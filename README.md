# TreasureHunt

Are you ready to hunt treasures just like in the Hive and Mineplex?

(Default model is made on my own. I am learning Blockbench recently and this is my first model!)

## Commands:
/treasurehunt create - create a treasure

/treasurehunt remove - remove a treasure

/treasurehunt clearall  -  clear all players' records

/treasurehunt help
